# SAMSA

This is my final project for my vocational training as computer science expert, subject area: sofware development. 
To run this project properly, an installation of node.js as well as aws-cli is required.

SAMSA stands for "Subscriptions and Account Management in a Serverless Application".

## Installation
Simply run "npm install" in the root folder.

## Deployment
Simply run "npm run full" in the root folder. The Cloud services should then be dployed automatically.
